# SimpleTMs: TMs and TRs for Cobblemon (Forge)

This Minecraft mod is an expansion to the Cobblemon mod, integrating TMs (Technical Machines) and TRs (Technical Records) from the Pokémon universe. The mod allows players to teach moves to their Pokémon, with either a TM or TR.

## Features

### TM and TR Usage
- **TMs:** Teach a move associated with that TM to a Pokémon. TMs have infinite uses.
- **TRs:** Also teach a move to a Pokémon, but TRs break after a single use.

### Configuration Options
- Enable Egg Moves and Tutor Moves: TMs and TRs can be configured to teach Egg Moves and Tutor Moves to Pokémon.
- Allow Any Move Transfer: Configure the mod to enable any move to be transferred to any Pokémon.
- **Cooldown Functionality**
  - Configurable cooldown duration for TMs after use.
  - Tooltip to indicate the remaining cooldown time for a TM.

### Item Functionality
- Blank TM or TR functionality: Transfer the first move in a Pokémon's equipped moves to a blank TM or TR, granting the associated TM or TR to the player.

### Obtaining Items
- TMs and TRs are currently only obtainable in Creative Mode.

## Configuration

Modify the mod's configuration file (`config/simpletms_config.properties`) to customize the following settings:

- **AnyMoveAnyPokemon**: Allows any move to be taught to any Pokémon by a TM or TR if true. *Defaults to false.*
- **EggMovesLearnable**: Allows moves in a Pokémon's egg moves list to be taught via TM or TR. *Defaults to false.*
- **TutorMovesLearnable**: Allows moves in a Pokémon's tutor moves list to be taught via TM or TR. *Defaults to false.*
- **ImprintableBlankTMs**: Blank TMs and TRs can be used on a Pokémon, and their first equipped move imprinted onto it. *Defaults to true.*
- **TMCooldownTicks**: Adjust the cooldown duration (in ticks) for TMs after use. *Defaults to 100 ticks (5 seconds).*

## Future development

- I would like to add the ability to imprint tms as held items on Pokémon when a move is used, but I have to figure out how to do that first.
- Additionally, I would like a config option to introduce TMs as loot drops from Pokémon and in dungeons chests. 
- Lastly, I want to add a config option to bring a recipe into the game
